## Description:
Asha Music is a streaming service that allows users to have a personalized music listening experience. Users can create playlists, tailor music recommendations, and upgrade to an Artist account, allowing them to upload music. One of our developers, Abed Islam, is a musical artist. He has noticed the disparity between local and popular artists and believes that it is imperative bridge the gap between the two groups. This application will give local aspiring artists the opportunity to connect with the artists that inspire them and give artists with larger fanbases the ability to provide mentoring services and develop personal connections with their audience.
